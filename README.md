The task asked to implement various image processing techniques, like convolution, converting an image to grayscale, adding and removing noise or border detection without using any libraries that perform these actions. So I implemented them using only numpy for efficient management of multidimensional arrays and matplotlib.pyplot to print the results out.

Some precomputed results can be seen in demo1.ipynb.
